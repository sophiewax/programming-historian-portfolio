Recap:
This lesson taught me how to count word frequencies in a text corpus using Python. I followed the Programming Historian tutorial to import .txt files, clean the text, and count/display the most common words. I expanded on the lesson by applying it to a collection of women's suffrage speeches using Python’s collections.Counter module, and created bar charts to visualize results.

Lesson 2: TF-IDF for Historical Texts

Recap:
This lesson focused on applying TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) to historical writings. I adapted it to compare pro- and anti-suffrage texts from the early 20th century. I wrote a Jupyter notebook to compute TF-IDF scores and visualized key differences using scatterplots, helping reveal ideological divides through computational methods.

Lesson 3: Sentiment Analysis

Recap:
This lesson introduced basic sentiment analysis using Python’s TextBlob library. I learned to calculate polarity and subjectivity scores, clean text data, and visualize sentiment trends. I applied this method to analyze mood and tone in a small collection of texts related to women's rights.
