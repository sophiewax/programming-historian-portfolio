Sophie Wax Portfolio for Programming Historian Lessons

Lesson 1: Word Frequencies

Recap:
This lesson taught me how to count word frequencies in a text corpus using Python. I followed the tutorial to import .txt files, clean the text, and count/display the most common words. I expanded the exercise by analyzing a collection of women’s suffrage speeches using Python’s collections.Counter and visualized the results with bar charts.

Lesson 2: TF-IDF for Historical Texts

my_url: https://github.com/sophiewax/programming-historian-portfolio/blob/main/TF-IDF%20for%20Historical%20Texts.ipynb

Recap:
This lesson covered TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) as a method to analyze historical texts. I used it to compare pro-suffrage and anti-suffrage writings from the early 20th century. I calculated TF-IDF scores in a Jupyter notebook and created scatterplots to highlight differing vocabularies, which helped visualize ideological distinctions between the two groups.

Lesson 3: Sentiment Analysis

Recap:
This lesson introduced sentiment analysis using Python’s TextBlob library. I learned to assign polarity and subjectivity scores to texts, clean and preprocess the data, and visualize overall sentiment distributions. This gave me practical experience with basic natural language processing tools.
